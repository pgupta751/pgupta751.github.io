I am currently a research assistant in the Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, working with Prof. Jenna DiVincenzo. I work on gradual verification, a techique that seamlessly combines static (compile time) and dynamic (run time) verification techniques to enable incremental specification and verification of code.

I am interested in formal methods research and its potential to improve how developers write and reason about software.
