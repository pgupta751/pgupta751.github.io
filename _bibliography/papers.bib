  abstract = {Quantum computing has emerged in recent years as a rapidly evolving field, presenting the potential to solve problems that are difficult for classical computers. Our work presents a new implementation of procedural generation using Wave Function Collapse (WFC), solved using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The problem is formatted as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the edge rules in classical WFC are encoded as linear constraints. We successfully demonstrate the generation of valid tile configuration in both 2D and 3D, showcasing the potential of quantum computing in hybrid quantum-classical systems. However, our algorithm is constrained by limitations set by current quantum computers, which prevents real-world deployment at this stage.},
